## TCP Interface Overview
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a core protocol of the Internet Protocol Suite that enables reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between applications. Key features include:
- **Connection-Oriented**: Ensures reliable communication by establishing a connection before data transmission.
- **Reliable Data Transfer**: Guarantees data integrity and order.
- **Flow Control**: Manages data transmission rates.
- **Congestion Control**: Adapts to network traffic conditions.
